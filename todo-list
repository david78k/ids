adjacency matrix: combine titles and inlinks or only inlinks?
- When creating the adjacency matrix, should we combine titles and inlinks or consider only inlinks? 
  I'm asking this because the inlinks may also be titles (nodes). 
- Should we distingush titles in upper case and lower case?
- should the titles be unique?

Are the directories such as results in output directory layout assumed to be already created in S3 in the grading test environment or should they be created at runtime?

total number of pages N
"You should produce a inlink graph le named PageRank.inlink.out as described below: 
pageTitle inlink1 inlink2 inlink3 ... inlinkn.

Suppose that we have two pages with five links like below.
pageTitle1 inlink1 inlink2 inlink3.
pageTitle2 inlink4 inlink5.
In this case, is N 5?
