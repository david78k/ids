input output directory as arguments

adjacency matrix: combine titles and inlinks or only inlinks?
- When creating the adjacency matrix, should we combine titles and inlinks or consider only inlinks? 
  I'm asking this because the inlinks may also be titles (nodes). 
- Should we distingush titles in upper case and lower case?
- should the titles be unique?

Are the directories such as results in output directory layout assumed to be already created in S3 in the grading test environment or should they be created at runtime?
