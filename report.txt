Description

1. The steps we took to develop the code:
- 1) non-MR on local machine
- 2) MR with Hadoop on local machine
- 3) EMR on AWS
 
2. Difficulties we faced:
- parsing xml page was not easy. at first, we were trying to use a parser
library, but we couldn't get it right. After all, we parsed manually to get
what we want.

- too many specifications to follow

- data manipulation: sort, order, key-valye mapping, indexing,
  
- creating a jar file: combine separate files (external jars) into one was hard

- normalizing matrices to make the matrix column stochastic

3. How we solved the problems:
   
4. What we learned
 
5. Optimizations
- sparse matrix (deprecated) for the adjacency matrix A as most of the entries are zero
