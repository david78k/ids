How to compile and run
- compile: make compile
- run: make run
- you can edit makefile to change the input file. The default input file is
  100000_key-value_pairs.csv under the current working directory.
- mpicc -foepnmp -std=c99 -o out file
- mpirun [--nolocal] [-np 4] [-machinefile machinefile] out
	where -np is the number of processors

implementation methods, experimental settings, outputs and corresponding
conclusions

implementation methods
- c++ standard library (stl) is used.
- At first, unordered_map is used for hash tables. Later, I realized that the
  order of the output is wrong. So, I used map under stl.
- too hard to send vector type: when sending key-value pair list to each processor, I had to convert
  the vector of key-value pairs to 2-dimensional int array.
- maximum number of message (int array): 16375*2 = 32760 (integers)

experimental settings
- IBM Blade HS22 8cores with 16threads (16 logical processors) with 24GB ram
- output order messy without synchronization: needed barrier
- compare single processor and multiprocessors

outputs and corresponding conclusions
- single processor
  run1 0.666
  run2 0.362
  run3 0.354
  run4 0.360
  run5 0.356

  multiple processors: np -4
  run1 1.356
  run2 1.341
  run3 1.338
  run4 1.349
  run5 1.338
  
  np -8
  run1 1.530
  run2 1.482
  run3 1.353
  run4 1.357
  run5 1.427

  np -16
  run1 1.959
  run2 1.836
  run3 1.771
  run4 1.863
  run5 1.589

- output file: Output_Task2.txt
- output format: key and sum of values are separated by a tab
- single processor is faster than multiprocessors. this is because the dataset
  size is too small to take advantage of parallel processing. Rather,
communicaion overhead would've dominate the running time.

- What are you looking for regarding performance results in the project
  report?
Mainly refer to the output results, and based on this you need to give some
analysis of advantages using corresponding parallel computing method (not need
too much). Additionally for the implementation, you need to give more details.
