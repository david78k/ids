	where -np is the number of processors

implementation methods, experimental settings, outputs and corresponding
conclusions

implementation methods
- unordered_map is used for hash tables.

experimental settings
-

outputs and corresponding conclusions
- output format: key and sum of values are separated by a tab

- What are you looking for regarding performance results in the project
  report?
Mainly refer to the output results, and based on this you need to give some
analysis of advantages using corresponding parallel computing method (not need
too much). Additionally for the implementation, you need to give more details.
