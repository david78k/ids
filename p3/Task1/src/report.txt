Questions
- what is the input argument? web graph file? isn't it hardcoded?

How to compile and run
- type 'make' in the current directory

implementation methods, experimental settings, outputs and corresponding
conclusions

implementation methods
- Undirected Facebook graph is used. I consider the edge "a - b" as both "a -> b" and "b -> a" links.

experimental settings
- damping factor = 0.85
- conversion condition: epsilon = 0.001

outputs and corresponding conclusions
- weird results: without openmp and with openmp gave different results. Also, every
  time I run with openmp, different results come out.

- the running time was also significantly different. For conversion condition epsilon 0.0001, without openmp it took
  few seconds with less than 30 iterations whereas it took few minutes with
30K iterations to run with openmp. I thought that something was wrong.

- What are you looking for regarding performance results in the project
  report?
Mainly refer to the output results, and based on this you need to give some
analysis of advantages using corresponding parallel computing method (not need
too much). Additionally for the implementation, you need to give more details.
