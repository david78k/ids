Questions
- what is the input argument? web graph file? isn't it hardcoded?

Todo list
- input argument
- synchronization totalsum
- partition parallel sections by threadID
- sort the output

How to compile and run
- compile: make compile
- run: make run
- you can edit the makefile to change the input file. The default input file
  is facebook_combined.txt under the current working directory.
- files: pagerank.c, makefile
	pagerank.c: all functions including main() function
- type 'make' in the current directory
- you can separately compile and run
  make compile
  make run

implementation methods, experimental settings, outputs and corresponding
conclusions

implementation methods
- Undirected Facebook graph is used. I consider the edge "a - b" as both "a -> b" and "b -> a" links.

experimental settings
- damping factor = 0.85
- varying conversion conditions: epsilon = 0.001-1e-7

outputs and corresponding conclusions
- vector norm (L1, L2) is important for running time. L1 norm takes 60 iterations
  while L2 norm 40 iterations (epsilon = 1e-7).

- weird results: without openmp and with openmp gave different results. Also, every
  time I run with openmp, different results come out.
  => This is because of roundoff errors and the order of computation.
deterministic with a single thread and nondeterministic with openmp
multi-threads

- the running time was also significantly different. For conversion condition epsilon 0.0001, without openmp it took
  few seconds with less than 30 iterations whereas it took few minutes with
30K iterations to run with openmp. I thought that something was wrong.

epsilon = 0.001
iter = 0, diff = 18222.705571, epsilon = 0.001000
iter = 8, diff = 0.000881, epsilon = 0.001000

epsilon = 0.005
iter = 0, diff = 18222.705571, epsilon = 0.000500
iter = 11, diff = 0.000477, epsilon = 0.000500

- give some analysis of advantages using corresponding parallel computing
  method (not need too much). Additionally for the implementation, you need to
give more details.

- What are you looking for regarding performance results in the project
  report?
Mainly refer to the output results, and based on this you need to give some
analysis of advantages using corresponding parallel computing method (not need
too much). Additionally for the implementation, you need to give more details.
